# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the SEOnaut repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the main branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
